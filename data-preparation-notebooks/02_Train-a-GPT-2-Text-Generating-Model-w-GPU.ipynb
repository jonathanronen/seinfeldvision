George: (surprised) What?! Kramer: You believe me? (starts pouring a glass of wine) Alright, So, the movie's set in the nineteen-thirt... George: Nineteen-thirt... Nineteen-thirt. Thirty-five dollars. (makes swallowing noises) Kramer: (impatient) Five hundred dollars, fifty-five fifty dollars. George: Alright, yep. Alright. Fifty-five dollars.

And it rained earlier today than yesterday. That's because yesterday was my period. Jerry: (adamant) You are not exaggerating. (starts finishing his wine) What? Kramer: Yeah, today was my period. I've never been piquered. Jerry: You mean, all the time you've been pumping yourself full of Dilaudid? Kramer: Every moment I've stayed up, drinking is time wasted.

Kramer: It's the click of a rubber mallet against a wooden countertop.   Jerry: Wait a minute, what is that noise? Are you using your toilet?   Kramer: Oh, that's my urine dispenser. It dispenses with a bowl.   Jerry: A bowl!? That is not a bowl.   Kramer: Well, I got a whole roll of toilet paper in there too, you know.   Jerry: Then what's the difference?   Kramer: Look, I'll just get the paper, okay?   Kramer goes into the bedroom to get the paper dispenser and turns to say   something to the sliding glass door.

Unique to GPT-2, you can pass a `batch_size` to generate multiple samples in parallel, giving a massive speedup (in Colaboratory, set a maximum of 20 for `batch_size`).\n","\n","Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n","\n","*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n","* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n","* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n","* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n","*  **`include_prefix`**: If using `truncate` and `include_prefix=False`, the specified `prefix` will not be included in the returned text."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8DKMc0fiej4N","colab_type":"code","outputId":"ec1fc622-c3fe-43e5-9312-f26cec6e52fa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1555618327694,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":9197,"user":{"displayName":"Max Woolf","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SAn9dAVrqaw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA0o/9b0Ok-MDXIU/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"10954469476206133987"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":3679}},"source":["gpt2.generate(sess,\n","              length=250,\n","              temperature=0.7,\n","              prefix=\"LORD\",\n","              nsamples=5,\n","              batch_size=5\n","              )"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["LORD FITZWATER:\n","Saw'st thou not, sir?\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","Madam, didst thou not mean, as some do,\n","To cram others with beggary?\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","Ha, ha! what should you say? why didst thou say no?\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","Hath this woman in this world hungrier than man?\n","Think'st thou that all these woes can be avoided?\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","As many lives she hath prevented as man.\n","\n","DUCHESS OF YORK:\n","Why, hark! the Tower is brought down.\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","The King of Naples comes apace.\n","\n","DUCHESS OF YORK:\n","It shall be so, I hope.\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","The Tower comes down.\n","\n","DUCHESS OF YORK:\n","The Naples comes apace.\n","\n","QUEEN ELIZABETH:\n","It shall be so, I hope.\n","\n","DUCHESS OF YORK:\n","\n","====================\n","\n","LORDY:\n","Every man that's gone hath died\n","And that's the end of all.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","Your lordship must be revenged, Hermione.\n","\n","LADY ANNE:\n","And she shall be the man that I dreamt of.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","I cannot sleep: never a waking man shall\n","Go to any sleepder than to sleep.\n","\n","LADY ANNE:\n","It shall be such a dream, I'll bear witness to it,\n","That I may believe what I say.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","All tongues to hell: never man to man,\n","Let light hear me?\n","\n","LADY ANNE:\n","No, I'll not bear witness to it.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","I said you had heard it, but could not put\n","You in words.\n","\n","LADY ANNE:\n","It is a strange tale, the tale doth it:\n","Hermione's great care is felling on wild Bolingbroke,\n","And Bolingbroke is the king.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","I could not put mine hand\n","====================\n","\n","LORD FITZWATER:\n","On pain of death, will he live to see this day\n","His country requite itself again.\n","\n","DUKE OF YORK:\n","What country?\n","\n","HENRY BOLINGBROKE:\n","Nor none but himself,\n","That is, most certainly, from this day on\n","My proudest unknown man shall be your king.\n","\n","DUKE OF AUMERLE:\n","Of all men I am the one who shall lose.\n","\n","HENRY BOLINGBROKE:\n","Take thou the crown, and crown it well\n","With all the proudest that have touch'd it.\n","\n","DUKE OF YORK:\n","I'll have the crown too, and set it on me.\n","\n","HENRY BOLINGBROKE:\n","Now York shall stand for his wish.\n","\n","DUKE OF YORK:\n","Stand you like a leader, like a great king\n","And will you yield all obedience to him?\n","\n","HENRY BOLINGBROKE:\n","I'll be king, I vow thee.\n","\n","DUKE OF YORK:\n","And shall stand for that aim so well\n","In all\n","====================\n","\n","LORD FITZWATER:\n","Sir, your company is witness to that.\n","\n","Servant:\n","The duke shall have a chamber-maid,\n","And not an officer of the people, to take\n","The absolute duke of his city.\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","That's as many rogues as there are.\n","\n","Servant:\n","Nine!\n","\n","Servant:\n","Nine rogues!\n","\n","Servant:\n","Nine!\n","\n","GLOUCESTER:\n","A foul witch!
